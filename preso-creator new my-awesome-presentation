This command will create a new directory named `my-awesome-presentation` in your current location. This directory will be populated with all the necessary files to run the presentation, including:

- `index.html`: The main entry point.
- `styles.css`: All the styling for the presentation.
- `js/`: Directory containing all JavaScript logic.
- `slides/`: Directory where you should place your HTML slide files.

After generating the project, you can start a local web server in the `my-awesome-presentation` directory to view your presentation.

## Customization

- **Slides**: Add or edit HTML files in the `slides/` directory.
- **Configuration**: Modify `js/config.js` to change the number of slides (`SLIDE_COUNT`).
- **Styling**: Customize the look and feel by editing `styles.css`.
